The game's unique turn system is divided into two primary components: Time Effects and Turn Effects.

- **Time Effects ("Planning Phase")**: Preparatory stage is crucial for setting up moves, attacks, and defensive strategies. It's a strategic pause that occur before every execution turns, where players plan and set actions for their characters in the battle arena. 
    
- **Turn Execution ("Execution Phase")**: The Execution Phase is where the everyone planned actions intersect, bringing about the dynamic results of combat. It encompasses the sequence of events within a turn, including the actions of both players and their characters.
##### Phases of a Turn execution

A turn unfolds in three distinct phases: Beginning (start, Physical Reducer, and End).

1. **Start (Pre-calculation phase)**: At the start of a turn, the game pre-calculates potential outcomes based on characters' stats and planned actions. This includes determining the velocity of projectiles, calculating potential damage, and assessing hit probabilities, all influenced by traits such as strength, agility, and reflex.
    
2. **Execution (Physical reducer or execution phase)**: This phase presents a historical and visual account of the turn's events, translating complex interactions into an accessible format for players. It details the movements, attacks, and spells cast, along with the impact of characters' traits on these actions. The Physical Reducer serves as both a record and a demonstration of the turn's dynamics.
    
3. **End (Resolution phase)**: Concluding the turn, this phase consolidates the outcomes of actions into a comprehensive snapshot, setting the stage for the next cycle of planning and execution.
